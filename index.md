## 30 DAYS OF CODE Challenge





## DAY 1
okay, so I started with JavaScript and completed:
- Variable declaration using var and let
- Create a variable: const
- Mathematical Assignment Operators

## DAY 2
- increment and decrement operator(var ++ or var -- )
- string concatenation (using + between two different strings)
- string interpolation (using `` instead of " and ${var name} to concatenate) 
- typeof operator: to know the datatype of the value inside the var

## DAY 3
- Completed two problems from codecademy.

## DAY 4&5
Learnt how to use if, else if, switch and ternary syntax tk control the flow of a program in JavaScript

## DAY 6
Started with a project.

## DAY 7-10

Working on a full stack project with tailwind css 
Till now built the:
- Login page
- Forgot password page
- Create a new account page 
- The actual landing page.

## DAY 11-12

1.truthy and falsy


falsy examples:
- 0
- Empty strings like "" or ''
- null which represent when there is no value at all
- undefined which represent when a declared variable lacks a value
- NaN, or Not a Number

2. short circuit evaluation

- let username = '';
- let defaultName = username || 'Stranger';
- console.log(defaultName); // Prints: Stranger

here value of default name is stranger since usrname is falsy

3. ternary operator

In the example above: 
- The condition, isNightTime, is provided before the ?. 
- Two expressions follow the ? and are separated by a colon :. 
- If the condition evaluates to true, the first expression executes. 
- If the condition evaluates to false, the second expression executes. 
 
**difference b/w == and ===

4. else if statements
- The else if statements allow you to have multiple possible outcomes. 
- if/else if/else statements are read from top to bottom, so the first condition that evaluates to true from the top to bottom is the block that gets executed.

## DAY 13
- switch statements

- The switch keyword initiates the statement and is followed by ( ... ), which contains the value that each case will compare. In the example, the value or expression of the switch statement is groceryItem.
- Inside the block, { ... }, there are multiple cases. The case keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that comes after it. The value following the first case is 'tomato'. If the value of groceryItem equalled 'tomato', that case‘s console.log() would run.
- The value of groceryItem is 'papaya', so the third case runs— Papayas are $1.29 is logged to the console.
- The break keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block. Note: Without break keywords, the first matching case will run, but so will every subsequent case regardless of whether or not it matches—including the default. This behavior is different from if/else conditional statements that execute only one block of code.
- At the end of each switch statement, there is a default statement. If none of the cases are true, then the code in the default statement will run.
