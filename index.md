## 30 DAYS OF CODE Challenge





## DAY 1
okay, so I started with JavaScript and completed:
- Variable declaration using var and let
- Create a variable: const
- Mathematical Assignment Operators

## DAY 2
- increment and decrement operator(var ++ or var -- )
- string concatenation (using + between two different strings)
- string interpolation (using `` instead of " and ${var name} to concatenate) 
- typeof operator: to know the datatype of the value inside the var
