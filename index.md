okay, so I started with JavaScript and completed:
- Variable declaration using var and let
- Create a variable: const
- Mathematical Assignment Operators

## DAY 2
- increment and decrement operator(var ++ or var -- )
- string concatenation (using + between two different strings)
- string interpolation (using `` instead of " and ${var name} to concatenate) 
- typeof operator: to know the datatype of the value inside the var

## DAY 11-12

1.truthy and falsy


falsy examples:
-0
-Empty strings like "" or ''
-null which represent when there is no value at all
-undefined which represent when a declared variable lacks a value
-NaN, or Not a Number

2. short circuit evaluation

let username = '';
let defaultName = username || 'Stranger';
 
console.log(defaultName); // Prints: Stranger


here value of default name is stranger since usrname is falsy

3. ternary operator

In the example above: 
The condition, isNightTime, is provided before the ?. 
Two expressions follow the ? and are separated by a colon :. 
If the condition evaluates to true, the first expression executes. 
If the condition evaluates to false, the second expression executes. 
 
**difference b/w == and ===

4. else if statements
The else if statements allow you to have multiple possible outcomes. if/else if/else statements are read from top to bottom, so the first condition that evaluates to true from the top to bottom is the block that gets executed.
